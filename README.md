# vrNeuroPy

This Unity-VR framework as been created to simulate different kinds of learning scenarios within scenes created in Unity. This is done by adding a network API to Unity, making it possible for a client software to send commands to Unity as well as parallely receive sensory information, such as images, in real time. This can be seen as a budget alternative to a robot, which can also provide sensory information needed for various learning algorithms.
